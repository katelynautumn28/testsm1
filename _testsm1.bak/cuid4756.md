description: This is a legal record of ownership of Shelter Island, with mention of
  original “Manhansucke” indigenous ownership and that the island was called “Ahaquatzunamocke”
  by them. This document is also emblematic of the Sylvester Manor’s relationship
  to the Barbados plantations, and the Sylvesters’ dependency on the slave trade.
